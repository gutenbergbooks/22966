<p>Because there were few adults in
the crowd, and Colonel "Biff" Hawton
stood over six feet tall, he could
see every detail of the demonstration.
The children&mdash;and most of the
parents&mdash;gaped in wide-eyed wonder.
Biff Hawton was too sophisticated
to be awed. He stayed on because
he wanted to find out what the
trick was that made the gadget work.</p>

<p>"It's all explained right here in
your instruction book," the demonstrator
said, holding up a garishly
printed booklet opened to a four-color
diagram. "You all know how
magnets pick up things and I bet
you even know that the earth itself is
one great big magnet&mdash;that's why
compasses always point north. Well
... the Atomic Wonder Space
Wave Tapper hangs onto those space
waves. Invisibly all about us, and
even going right through us, are the
magnetic waves of the earth. The
Atomic Wonder rides these waves
just the way a ship rides the waves
in the ocean. Now watch...."</p>

<p>Every eye was on him as he put the
gaudy model rocketship on top of the
table and stepped back. It was made
of stamped metal and seemed as incapable
of flying as a can of ham&mdash;which
it very much resembled. Neither
wings, propellors, nor jets broke
through the painted surface. It rested
on three rubber wheels and coming
out through the bottom was a double
strand of thin insulated wire. This
white wire ran across the top of the
black table and terminated in a control
box in the demonstrator's hand.
An indicator light, a switch and a
knob appeared to be the only controls.</p>

<p>"I turn on the Power Switch, sending
a surge of current to the Wave
Receptors," he said. The switch
clicked and the light blinked on and
off with a steady pulse. Then the
man began to slowly turn the knob.
"A careful touch on the Wave Generator
is necessary as we are dealing
with the powers of the whole world
here...."</p>

<p>A concerted <i>ahhhh</i> swept through
the crowd as the Space Wave Tapper
shivered a bit, then rose slowly into
the air. The demonstrator stepped
back and the toy rose higher and
higher, bobbing gently on the invisible
waves of magnetic force that
supported it. Ever so slowly the power
was reduced and it settled back to
the table.</p>

<p>"Only $17.95," the young man
said, putting a large price sign on the
table. "For the complete set of the
Atomic Wonder, the Space Tapper
control box, battery and instruction
book ..."</p>

<p>At the appearance of the price
card the crowd broke up noisily and
the children rushed away towards the
operating model trains. The demonstrator's
words were lost in their
noisy passage, and after a moment he
sank into a gloomy silence. He put
the control box down, yawned and
sat on the edge of the table. Colonel
Hawton was the only one left after
the crowd had moved on.</p>

<p>"Could you tell me how this thing
works?" the colonel asked, coming
forward. The demonstrator brightened
up and picked up one of the
toys.</p>

<p>"Well, if you will look here,
sir...." He opened the hinged top.
"You will see the Space Wave coils
at each end of the ship." With a pencil
he pointed out the odd shaped
plastic forms about an inch in diameter
that had been wound&mdash;apparently
at random&mdash;with a few turns of
copper wire. Except for these coils
the interior of the model was empty.
The coils were wired together and
other wires ran out through the hole
in the bottom of the control box.
Biff Hawton turned a very quizzical
eye on the gadget and upon the demonstrator
who completely ignored this
sign of disbelief.</p>

<p>"Inside the control box is the battery,"
the young man said, snapping
it open and pointing to an ordinary
flashlight battery. "The current goes
through the Power Switch and Power
Light to the Wave Generator ..."</p>

<p>"What you mean to say," Biff
broke in, "is that the juice from this
fifteen cent battery goes through this
cheap rheostat to those meaningless
coils in the model and absolutely
nothing happens. Now tell me what
really flies the thing. If I'm going to
drop eighteen bucks for six-bits
worth of tin, I want to know what
I'm getting."</p>

<p>The demonstrator flushed. "I'm
sorry, sir," he stammered. "I wasn't
trying to hide anything. Like any
magic trick this one can't be really
demonstrated until it has been purchased."
He leaned forward and whispered
confidentially. "I'll tell you
what I'll do though. This thing is way
overpriced and hasn't been moving at
all. The manager said I could let them
go at three dollars if I could find any
takers. If you want to buy it for that
price...."</p>

<p>"Sold, my boy!" the colonel said,
slamming three bills down on the
table. "I'll give that much for it no
matter <i>how</i> it works. The boys in the
shop will get a kick out of it," he
tapped the winged rocket on his
chest. "Now <i>really</i>&mdash;what holds it
up?"</p>

<p>The demonstrator looked around
carefully, then pointed. "Strings!" he
said. "Or rather a black thread. It
runs from the top of the model,
through a tiny loop in the ceiling,
and back down to my hand&mdash;tied to
this ring on my finger. When I back
up&mdash;the model rises. It's as simple as
that."</p>

<p>"All good illusions are simple,"
the colonel grunted, tracing the black
thread with his eye. "As long as
there is plenty of flimflam to distract
the viewer."</p>

<p>"If you don't have a black table, a
black cloth will do," the young man
said. "And the arch of a doorway is a
good site, just see that the room in
back is dark."</p>

<p>"Wrap it up, my boy, I wasn't born
yesterday. I'm an old hand at this
kind of thing."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Biff Hawton sprang it at the next
Thursday-night poker party. The
gang were all missile men and they
cheered and jeered as he hammed
up the introduction.</p>

<p>"Let me copy the diagram, Biff, I
could use some of those magnetic
waves in the new bird!"</p>

<p>"Those flashlight batteries are
cheaper than lox, this is the thing of
the future!"</p>

<p>Only Teddy Kaner caught wise as
the flight began. He was an amateur
magician and spotted the gimmick at
once. He kept silent with professional
courtesy, and smiled ironically as
the rest of the bunch grew silent one
by one. The colonel was a good showman
and he had set the scene well.
He almost had them believing in the
Space Wave Tapper before he was
through. When the model had landed
and he had switched it off he couldn't
stop them from crowding around
the table.</p>

<p>"A thread!" one of the engineers
shouted, almost with relief, and they
all laughed along with him.</p>

<p>"Too bad," the head project physicist
said, "I was hoping that a little
Space Wave Tapping could help us
out. Let me try a flight with it."</p>

<p>"Teddy Kaner first," Biff announced.
"He spotted it while you
were all watching the flashing lights,
only he didn't say anything."</p>

<p>Kaner slipped the ring with the
black thread over his finger and started
to step back.</p>

<p>"You have to turn the switch on
first," Biff said.</p>

<p>"I know," Kaner smiled. "But
that's part of illusion&mdash;the spiel and
the misdirection. I'm going to try
this cold first, so I can get it moving
up and down smoothly, then go
through it with the whole works."</p>

<p>He moved his hand back smoothly,
in a professional manner that drew
no attention to it. The model lifted
from the table&mdash;then crashed back
down.</p>

<p>"The thread broke," Kaner said.</p>

<p>"You jerked it, instead of pulling
smoothly," Biff said and knotted the
broken thread. "Here let me show
you how to do it."</p>

<p>The thread broke again when Biff
tried it, which got a good laugh that
made his collar a little warm. Someone
mentioned the poker game.</p>

<p>This was the only time that poker
was mentioned or even remembered
that night. Because very soon after
this they found that the thread would
lift the model only when the switch
was on and two and a half volts
flowing through the joke coils. With
the current turned off the model was
too heavy to lift. The thread broke
every time.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"I still think it's a screwy idea,"
the young man said. "One week getting
fallen arches, demonstrating
those toy ships for every brat within
a thousand miles. Then selling the
things for three bucks when they
must have cost at least a hundred dollars
apiece to make."</p>

<p>"But you <i>did</i> sell the ten of them
to people who would be interested?"
the older man asked.</p>

<p>"I think so, I caught a few Air
Force officers and a colonel in missiles
one day. Then there was one official
I remembered from the Bureau
of Standards. Luckily he didn't recognize
me. Then those two professors
you spotted from the university."</p>

<p>"Then the problem is out of our
hands and into theirs. All we have to
do now is sit back and wait for results."</p>

<p>"<i>What</i> results?! These people
weren't interested when we were
hammering on their doors with the
proof. We've patented the coils and
can prove to anyone that there is a
reduction in weight around them
when they are operating...."</p>

<p>"But a small reduction. And we
don't know what is causing it. No
one can be interested in a thing like
that&mdash;a fractional weight decrease in
a clumsy model, certainly not enough
to lift the weight of the generator.
No one wrapped up in massive fuel
consumption, tons of lift and such is
going to have time to worry about a
crackpot who thinks he has found a
minor slip in Newton's laws."</p>

<p>"You think they will now?" the
young man asked, cracking his knuckles
impatiently.</p>

<p>"I <i>know</i> they will. The tensile
strength of that thread is correctly adjusted
to the weight of the model.
The thread will break if you try to
lift the model with it. Yet you can
lift the model&mdash;after a small increment
of its weight has been removed
by the coils. This is going to bug
these men. Nobody is going to ask
them to solve the problem or concern
themselves with it. But it will
nag at them because they know this
effect can't possibly exist. They'll see
at once that the magnetic-wave theory
is nonsense. Or perhaps true? We
don't know. But they will all be
thinking about it and worrying about
it. Someone is going to experiment
in his basement&mdash;just as a hobby of
course&mdash;to find the cause of the error.
And he or someone else is going
to find out what makes those coils
work, or maybe a way to improve
them!"</p>

<p>"And we have the patents...."</p>

<p>"Correct. They will be doing the
research that will take them out of
the massive-lift-propulsion business
and into the field of pure space
flight."</p>

<p>"And in doing so they will be making
us rich&mdash;whenever the time
comes to manufacture," the young
man said cynically.</p>

<p>"We'll all be rich, son," the older
man said, patting him on the shoulder.
"Believe me, you're not going to
recognize this old world ten years
from now."</p>
